# ForestR:
The goal for this project was to develop an application that would allow a user to find national parks based on current location. This project uses the Bulma framework, National Parks Service API (https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm), Mapquest API (https://developer.mapquest.com/), and IPAPI (https://ipapi.co/).

## APIs utilized

The National Parks Service API  was used for information on parks based on state. 

The MapQuest APIwas used to find things that can be done nearby based on search criteria.

The IP API was used for geolocation based on IP and geolocation js as default method; the former used as a substitute to geolocation being disabled.

Google Fonts used for font on home page.

The National Parks Service API provides less details about parks than the Government Recreation API and only allows for searching by State.
